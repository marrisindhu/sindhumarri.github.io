👋 Hi, I’m Sindhu Marri

🚀 Data Scientist | GenAI & LLM Engineer | Applied ML Researcher
📍 India | 🎓 IIT Guwahati (B.Tech)

I build production-grade machine learning and GenAI systems—from LLM-powered analytics assistants to multimodal retrieval systems—bridging research, engineering, and business impact.

🔬 What I Work On

Large Language Models (LLMs) – RAG, schema-aware prompting, SQL generation, guardrails

Applied Machine Learning – anomaly detection, recommendation systems, time-series forecasting

Multimodal AI – vision–language models, embedding-based retrieval

End-to-End ML Systems – APIs, data pipelines, dashboards, deployment

💼 Professional Experience
Data Scientist — Walmart Global Tech India

Jul 2023 – Present

🧠 Report Builder Bot (LLM-powered Analytics Assistant)

Built an LLM-driven text-to-SQL analytics assistant using LangChain and GPT-4

Designed metadata-driven vector stores for schema discovery and query grounding

Implemented RAG pipelines to align user intent with relevant dataset fields

Added schema-aware prompting & SQL guardrails, reducing hallucinations and failures by 70%

📊 Guided Insights (Retail Analytics Platform)

Built anomaly detection & root-cause analysis frameworks for supplier performance

Designed graph-based clustering + NLP embeddings to identify competitive peers

Introduced a Relative Performance Index, explaining 60% of competitive gaps

Increased weekly active users from 40 → 110+

Deployed FastAPI services, real-time Python + batch PySpark pipelines, and Looker dashboards
